# Estimation of Camera Locations in Highly Corrupted Scenarios: All About that Base, No Shape Trouble, CVPR 2018.

This project proposed a strategy for improving camera location estimation in structure from motion. Our strategy identifies severely
corrupted pairwise directions by using a geometric consistency condition. It then selects a cleaner set of pairwise directions
as a preprocessing step for common solvers. Please see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02591.pdf for details.
